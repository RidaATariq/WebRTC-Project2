# Future Improvements to Our Project

Projects 2 and 3 were a great learning experience, and my team and I really enjoyed building an application like this from the ground up. We were ambitious about the features we wanted to see in our final product, and while we were able to include some of them, our experience and time constraints limited the rest. If we were to continue working on this project beyond the scope of this course, there are a few key additions we’d make, some of which I will be further outlining in this proposal.
The main thing we would like to work on for future iterations would be a screen sharing feature. Our project is centered around online/remote students who still want the experience of being able to study with their peers, and being able to share slides and notes is large part of that. Multipeer connections have already been added to our project, and this feature would build off of those connections using the Screen Capture API — the getDisplayMedia() method in particular — so users can share either a screen, window/application, or tab when in a call with others. Needless to say, shared audio would also be required in many situations, and since that is not built into the getDisplayMedia() method by default, we would be enabling that by passing relevant options into the method (to both allow audio and refine it).
