# Future Improvements to Our Project

Projects 2 and 3 were great learning experiences. My team and I really enjoyed building a WebRTC application like this from the ground up. We were ambitious about the features we wanted to see in our final product, and while we were able to include some of them, our experience and time constraints limited the rest. If we were to continue working on this project beyond the scope of this course, there are a few key additions we would make, some of which I will be further outlining in this proposal.

The main thing we would like to work on for future iterations would be a screen sharing feature. Our project is centered around online/remote students who still want the experience of studying with their peers, and being able to share slides and notes is a large part of that. Multipeer connections have already been added to our project, and this feature would build off of those connections using the Screen Capture API — particularly the getDisplayMedia() method — so users can share either a screen, window/application, or tab when in a call with others. Needless to say, shared audio would also be required in many situations, and since that is not built into the getDisplayMedia() method by default, we would enable that via passing appropriate options into the method (to share and refine audio).

There are a few video upgrades we would like to bring as well, the main one being the ability to blur backgrounds or change them to a new image altogether. It would add a lot to our application in terms of user comfort and experience, but implementation may be a challenge due to the lack of resources and potentially the technology involved, primarily if it uses some sort of face/feature detection. In a similar vein, we hope to include some more lighthearted features as well, like filters that add things to the user’s face or even change it entirely. Although the main goal for this app is to provide a virtual study room, for many users, it may be their only interaction with their peers, and we would like to make that a fun experience.

Finally, there are a few things we would like to add to polish the overall application. Currently, there are no security measures in place, and anyone with access to a namespace can access a room. To prevent that, we would like to implement two main things: firstly, a validation system of sorts that ensures only users from a specific university can sign up/access the site, which can be done by validating email address domains, and secondly, the ability to add passwords to your room so sessions can be either public or private depending on the users’ preferences.

These enhancements will take much time and effort, but as developers, our goal is not to simply create a product but to create one that our users find value in and enjoy, and so we hope that after these updates and some more, we can have an application that meets that goal.
